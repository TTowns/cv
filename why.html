  <h1>My Goals</h1>
  <h3>1. Why do I want to learn this skill?</h3>
  <p>What does it mean to you? What are your motivations? Will you prove something to yourself or people around you? Will you get a raise because you’re better at your job or will you get a better job?</p>
  <p><em>I want to learn this skill to open up a different career path for myself.  What I am doing right now is not sustainable for my health.  I will not get a raise and most likely will be making less money for a while, but I think it will be worth it in the long run.</em></p>
  <h3>2. What will I achieve if I learn this skill?</h3>
  <p>Which doors will this skill open for you? Will you be able to earn more, have more flexibility in your work hours, work remotely and travel more?</p>
  <p><em>I believe that it will let me work remotely and will eventually allow me to make roughly the same.</em></p>
  <h3>3. How will this skill change my life and my career?</h3>
  <p>Would you get a raise at your current job or more respect from your boss once you’ve learnt this skill? Or will you be at Facebook, Amazon or Google instead? How would your life change?</p>
  <p><em>This would change my life and my career significantly as I would be doing something that I have never done before.  I would also be walking away from my career of the last 15 years.</em></p>
  <h3>4. How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family, friends and coworkers?</h3>
  <p>What will you be able to do for your family or friends once you’ve learnt this skill? How will it change the way they think of you? Will your coworkers respect you more?</p>
  <p><em>I believe that it will make the life of my family more challenging in the short term, but I hope to be a better husband and father through these changes.</em></p>
  <h3>5. How will I feel if I never accomplish this?</h3>
  <p>Would you feel disappointed? Would you feel like you’ve missed out?</p>
  <p><em>I will feel disappointed in myself that I kept doing something that I didn't enjoy.</em></p>
  <h3>6. What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?</h3>
  <p>Visualise it. What would life look like from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep? Will you be living by the sea? Would you kiss your beautiful wife/husband when you wake up?</p>
  <p><em>I would be able to spend more meaningful time with them and not be consumed with thoughts about what has happened at my job during the day.</em></p>
